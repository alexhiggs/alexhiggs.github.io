<div class=whitespace>
			<p>There are a limited number or resources for adults with Learning Disabilities(LDs). Most online resources are geared to the parents of children with Learning Disabilities. This lack of resources reflects the idea the LDs are something one grows out out. As other people with LDs know, this is not the case. Hopefully we have all learned strategies to help us cope, but that doesn't mean things are easy or that we've stopped experiencing challenges.</p>
			<p> This site aims to fill in a gap for adults with LDs who need resources, technical, legal and emotional to help them with higher education and career.</p>
